# Portfolio Backend (Express + MongoDB)

This project serves a small React contact form (served statically) and an API to save entries into MongoDB.

## Quick start

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `MONGODB_URI` (or run MongoDB locally)

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Run the server (dev with nodemon):

   npm run dev

4. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser to see the form.
